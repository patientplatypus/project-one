      <h3>Platypus Fact #1</h3>
      <p>On top of all the other strange things that make up this patchwork creation is a poison spur that the platypus can use for self-defense or aggression. This spur can easily kill small animals, including rival platypuses for mating, but it can also cause incredibly intense pain to fully grown human beings.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-3">
      <h3>Platypus Fact #2</h3>
      <p>Human beings have been trolling since long before the Internet was a thing and would probably find our pranks lazy at best. You see, back in the day, naturalists liked to play a game where they stitched up different animal parts and tried to see if they could convince people it was a new species. The duck-billed platypus was discovered at a time when this kind of global trolling was very popular. This caused most people at the time to believe the platypus to be an elaborate hoax. Many people were skeptical even after viewing a live specimen, refusing to believing their eyes.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-3">
      <h3>Platypus Fact #3</h3> 
      <p>Like many mammals, the platypus hunts for food, but it does things in its own uniquely freaky way. To begin with, these crepuscular little fellas do most of their hunting underwater despite being mammals. However, more strangely, platypus has no use for those common, everyday hunting senses like vision, hearing, and smell. To seal itself off from water, the platypus shuts off all of those normal senses and finds prey based solely on electrical signals and mechanical waves that it picks up using its bill. This allows the platypus to create a perfect representation of its surroundings to find prey, all from its own watertight cocoon.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-3">
      <h3>Another Platypus Fact!</h3> 
      <p>The experts who first spotted the platypus considered it a mystery. Apart from looking like a Frankenstein monster patched together from discarded animal parts, it is also one of the few mammals that lay eggs. Humans, cows, and most other mammals give live birth, but this furry little abomination had to buck the trend and pop out its young in oval shells like some kind of rebel. Other mammals laid eggs long ago, but the only one now left besides the platypus is the echidna. Scientists assigned them the exclusive monotreme category just so they would have some way to classify the latest nightmare to come out of Australia.</p>

      <h3>More Facts!</h3>
      <p>You&rsquo;d think that the platypus, being a mammal with legs, would be meant for land. Actually, the animal&rsquo;s very awkward outside of the water. The platypus has webbed feet, which are great for swimming and certainly increase its diving abilities. However, unfortunately for the platypus. this makes walking on land about half as energy efficient as swimming. The poor thing has to basically walk on its knuckles. The platypus does have some nails it can extend, and it uses them to dig for food or shelter. In fact, despite hunting underwater, the platypus usually spends the majority of any day holed up nearby in a dry burrow.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h3>Never Enough Facts</h3>
      <p>The platypus looks a fair bit like a furry beaver with webbed feet, but also has the bill of a duck. It looks like a carnival freak show; it was clearly dealt a difficult hand. But the platypus is always up for improving and making the best of the things. Despite the adults having no teeth whatsoever and often hunting food that requires a fair bit of breaking up, the platypus is doing just fine. When the platypus stirs up the muck at the bottom of the river to scoop up prey, it will often grab up gravel with it. It then uses this gravel to help break the prey up into smaller chunks. Say what you will about how they look, but the platypus seems to be the first animal to invent dentures.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h3>Yay Facts!</h3> 
      <p>As you know, our favorite little rebel likes to do everything differently from its mammal brethren, and as this extends to feeding its young as well. Like all mammals, the platypus feeds milk to its young. However, the platypus doesn&rsquo;t actually have teats at all and they aren&rsquo;t a necessary part of the process for this little freak. Females produce milk, but their mammary glands don&rsquo;t protrude as nipples. Instead, the areolae act as &quot;milk patches,&quot; which secrete milk much like skin secretes sweat. The little monsters can then lap up the milk straight from their mother&rsquo;s skin in some kind of odd, furry ritual offering to their heathen gods.</p>
